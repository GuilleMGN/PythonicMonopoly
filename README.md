# PythonicMonopoly

## Background

Harold's company has just started a new Real Estate Investment division to provide customers with a broader range of portfolio options. Harold was tasked with building a prototype dashboard, and he needs your help. The real estate team wants to trial this initial offering with investment opportunities for the Toronto market. If the new service is popular, then they can start to expand to other markets.

This dashboard's goal is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in Toronto.

Harold is to accomplish the following tasks:

1. [Complete a notebook of rental analysis](#Rental-Analysis)

2. [Create a dashboard of interactive visualizations to explore the market data](#Dashboard)

The data provided for this was retrieved from the following websites:

* [Toronto Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/)

* [Census Profile, 2016 Census - Toronto Metropolitan Area, Ontario and Canada](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CMACA&Code1=535&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&SearchText=toronto&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1&type=0)

#### Challenges
For the future, I could incorporate the dashboard functions to avoid code repetition throughout the rental analysis to make it clean and concise. Unfortunately due to limited time I had to find a different way to visualize my data. Incorporating the other technologies to my data visualization would help out as well. Overall, I did manage to get all tasks complete, however just a quick a code refactor would make the project complete.
